# Welcome to Ersilia!

## The Ersilia Model Hub

We are creating the Ersilia Model Hub, a free, **open-source** repository of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (**AI/ML**) models for **drug discovery**. Our platform is aimed at helping researchers identify drug candidates for orphan and neglected diseases, design molecules _de novo_, understand mechanisms of action or anticipate adverse side effects. The ultimate goal of Ersilia is to lower the barrier to drug discovery, encouraging academic groups and companies to pursue the development of new medicines following the principles of **Open Science**. Ersilia disseminates AI/ML models existing in the literature, as well as an in-house collection of models focused on **diseases** that are currently **neglected** by the pharmaceutical industry due to estimated low return on investment. Endemic diseases of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) belong to this category.
